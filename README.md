The goal of this tool is to help developers identify defects based on the existing software metrics using the state of the art machine learning model and thereby improve software quality, which ultimately leads to reducing the cost of software development both in the developing and maintenance phases. The focus is identifying defective modules so that the scope of software that needs to be examined for defects could be prioritized. This allows the developer to run test cases in the predicted modules. The proposed methodology helps in identifying modules that require immediate attention and the reliability of the software is vastly improved as the high priority defects are handled first.

<strong>Our Custom Model can predict the defects with 99% Accuracy!</strong>
